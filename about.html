                            highlighting stories of coffee from
                            around <br> the world. We have since been dedicated to bring <br>
                            the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in every <br>
                            shipment.</p>

                            along the way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee
                            at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we
                            travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and initiatives, and invest
                            in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight
                            tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

                            stages of harvest <br> and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control
                            program
                            to <br> avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a
                            <br>
                            roast
                            date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly <br> coffee, so that
                            brewing is easy and enjoyable.
